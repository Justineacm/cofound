While people have less attention, more mobility and tend to engage only with good content; trainings -especially in the corporate world- are still based on boring powerpoints, poor storytelling and low long-term impact.\n\nFor greater impact, we believe the use of technologies in education should address the way brain learns the best by: retaining attention, generating engagement, being playful, being accessible anytime, anywhere.\nOne rising technology gathers all of these features: Virtual Reality.\n\nProviding greater learning/education through VR is the purpose of our startup called Uptale (www.uptale.io). In other words, we are specialized in Immersive Learning.\n\nWe conceive from A to Z real-life gamified learning experiences (simulations, pedagogical visits, \"live my life\", safety exercices) in 360VR for learning professionals, trainers, consultants, teachers.\n\nThe first results obtained with our first clients are stunning:\n- 100% attention rate\n- 5x more engagement than any other media\n- 75-90% long-term knowledge retention (compared to 5-10% for a ppt presentation)\n\nWe want to make \"Immersive Learning\" available to as many teachers, consultants and trainers as possible to increase significantly efficiency of their learning programs.\nTherefore, we have built an unfair advantage behind our experiences: a unique cloud-based 360VR authoring tool.\n\nIt allows anyone, without any technical background nor prior training, to create, \"gamify\" and publish interactive learning experiences in 360VR compatible with all mobile and VR devices via a single URL! \nThis allow Learning & Development professionals, training companies, consulting groups, teachers, trainers, and even VR content creators to manage their own experiences autonomously in few hours.","firstName":"Dwayne","lastName":"ISERIEF","userId":"17355567","backgroundUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E16AQFhdK6OFbKCng/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1668524808268?e=1683763200&v=beta&t=CLmUGvrAA5IU7NZaussblfLzCsJXwgzdOF40I4AKu0M","vmid":"ACoAAAEI0y8BtvUuli7xHydg4x5JLfrQOaxzyzQ","linkedinSalesNavigatorUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAEI0y8BtvUuli7xHydg4x5JLfrQOaxzyzQ,name","connectionsUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAEI0y8BtvUuli7xHydg4x5JLfrQOaxzyzQ%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH","company":"Uptale","school":"OMNES Education","savedImg":"https://phantombuster.s3.amazonaws.com/mkrBVUuON2g/AP0OfVmemgW0iJPySh2f0Q/dwayneiserief.jpeg"},"jobs":[{"companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/11016482/","companyName":"Uptale","logoUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQF9nv7Lue8HAA/company-logo_400_400/0/1661330495824?e=1686182400&v=beta&t=fVbATJ_BizCEnwcqca29R20Imdr_DFwjuJUOSgZBJ4A","jobTitle":"Co-founder - COO","dateRange":"Sep 2016 - Present · 6 yrs 7 mos","description":"Uptale aims to democratize the practice of \"Immersive Learning\" with Virtual Reality in the education and professional Training Market.\n\nWe have built a Software-as-a-Service platform to enable creators to imagine, create, publish and monitor Immersive Learning experiences without a line of Code.

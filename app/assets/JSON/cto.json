co-fondateur du podcast Tech Rocks. \n\nDans cet épisode, on évoque : \n\n# La tech, qui occupe une place centrale dans la vie d’une entreprise, et qui peut la challenger en apportant des réponses et des innovations. \n\n# La nécessité de bien travailler son SEO, intégré à la stratégie de la société, pour tous les contenus digitaux.  \n\n# La tendance “bien-être” qui inonde les contenus et influence les différentes fonctionnalités sur Internet et les réseaux sociaux.  \n\n# L’importance de communiquer les études de Médiamétrie, en externe comme en interne, pour orienter au mieux son positionnement et optimiser la collaboration avec des partenaires.  \n\n# Les enjeux, comme l’uniformisation, soulevés par la stratégie de Unify, fondée uniquement sur des acquisitions. \n\n# La répartition inégale des audiences entre site web et application. \n\n# Le marché du web, très challengé au niveau du référencement, car il est régi par les règles et les algorithmes de Google. \n\n#

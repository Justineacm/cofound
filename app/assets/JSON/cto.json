co-fondateur du podcast Tech Rocks. \n\nDans cet épisode, on évoque : \n\n# La tech, qui occupe une place centrale dans la vie d’une entreprise, et qui peut la challenger en apportant des réponses et des innovations. \n\n# La nécessité de bien travailler son SEO, intégré à la stratégie de la société, pour tous les contenus digitaux.  \n\n# La tendance “bien-être” qui inonde les contenus et influence les différentes fonctionnalités sur Internet et les réseaux sociaux.  \n\n# L’importance de communiquer les études de Médiamétrie, en externe comme en interne, pour orienter au mieux son positionnement et optimiser la collaboration avec des partenaires.  \n\n# Les enjeux, comme l’uniformisation, soulevés par la stratégie de Unify, fondée uniquement sur des acquisitions. \n\n# La répartition inégale des audiences entre site web et application. \n\n# Le marché du web, très challengé au niveau du référencement, car il est régi par les règles et les algorithmes de Google. \n\n# Les différences SEO entre le contenu froid et le contenu chaud. \n\n# La commercialisation auprès des annonceurs de données ciblées et pertinentes. \n\n# Les dernières évolutions tech – des outils sont apparus pour faciliter l’expérience utilisateur et des métiers se sont développés : les développeurs front jouent un rôle de plus en plus important. \n\n# Le choix des annonceurs, qui se fait en fonction de leur impact carbone – l’écologie étant plus que jamais un enjeu essentiel du digital.","link":"https://mediarama.io/unify-faire-face-aux-enjeux-des-marques-digitales-de-tfi/"}]},"query":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsilberman","timestamp":"2023-03-08T15:34:06.770Z"},{"general":{"imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQFYnZs4uXC7XA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1646124389907?e=1683763200&v=beta&t=LMh9KzFpeZxgBfscOeliOBHiTqyJjd7yKm92-TUwrb8","fullName":"Jeremie

The main value proposition is to build the data backbone which is coherent with the actual industrial site. \n\nAlong with my Co-founder Laurent, our personal mission for this venture is to solve the day-to-day problem of heavy industries by providing them a tools to become more Digital, Safe and Climate friendly. \n\nAlso using this opportunity to build an environment for Researchers and Engineers to build technologies that are at the edge of scientific research. At SAMP we do deep research in the fields of 3D Point clouds, Graph mapping, 3D rendering and Computational Geometry.\n\noften I spend my time studying and discussing AI, Entrepreneurship, Climate, Science, Philosophy and Finance. Lets connect! :)\n\nEmail: shivani@samp.ai","subscribers":"1706","firstName":"Shivani","lastName":"Shah","userId":"220766000","backgroundUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D16AQHHMX0RFkTmkw/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1637521247247?e=1683763200&v=beta&t=tKyyP9703ZY3k-yAOx__zy2bAPWV8tv2tcYZ8NqXldI","vmid":"ACoAAA0onzAB31S36e_BwtSfbuwnDZmv_tD2bZU","linkedinSalesNavigatorUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAA0onzAB31S36e_BwtSfbuwnDZmv_tD2bZU,name","connectionsUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAA0onzAB31S36e_BwtSfbuwnDZmv_tD2bZU%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH","company":"Samp","school":"Université de Tours","savedImg":"https://phantombuster.s3.amazonaws.com/mkrBVUuON2g/4LS2WYdK9kGrsU7cRLj5mg/shivanishah21.jpeg"},"jobs":[{"companyUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/36997575/","companyName":"Samp","logoUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQGa_hCvev2NRw/company-logo_400_400/0/1578667170965?e=1686182400&v=beta&t=eSPxqwuFUSX090muIGrWzZfe8Wp8T0j3WQDghehCg4E","jobTitle":"Co-founder and CTO","dateRange":"Oct 2019 - Present · 3 yrs 6 mos","description":"Large industrial facilities are constantly being maintained and modernized by many players in order to keep them safe and efficient while dramatically decreasing their environmental footprint.
